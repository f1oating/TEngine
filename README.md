# TEngine

TEngine is a game engine based on a component-based architecture similar to Unity. The goal of the project is to create a full-fledged game engine with the tools necessary for development, so that people can use it to create their own games, and for educational purposes.

# Goals

At the moment, the task is to implement the basic functions of the engine without thinking about optimization and memory management. This engine uses OpenGL systems as renderers, a GLM math library, and a stb_image texture library.

# Setting up the enviroment

1. First we need to install our repository, do it with git clone or just download the archive.
2. Second we need install all library dependencies: glm (latest version on 2025),
glfw: (build from original website 2025), glew (build from original website 2025), stb_image.h (from github repository 2025)
3. Than copy all header files in include directory inside project, should be like this:

![include.png](README/include.png)

4. Copy your libs in lib folder, should be like this:

![lib.png](README/lib.png)

5. Run the project
